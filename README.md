# UrbanBus

## Overview

UrbanBus is a repository that integrates two key modules (**Backend** and **Frontend**) to provide a comprehensive solution for managing urban transportation systems. These modules were originally developed as part of separate projects and have been brought together in this repository for enhanced functionality and collaboration.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main components:

### 1. **Backend Module**
- **Location:** from the [BD project repository folder](https://github.com/GabrielMSilva04/BD_2024/tree/main/Projeto)
- **Description:** This module is focused on server-side operations, including data storage, querying, and transactional processes.  
- **Languages:** TSQL, Python, Dockerfile, and Shell.  
- **Origin:** Developed and maintained as part of this repository.

### 2. **Frontend Module**
- **Location:** Referenced from the [IHC-UrbanBus repository](https://github.com/martimsantos31/IHC-UrbanBus).
- **Description:** The frontend module handles the user interface and interactions, offering tools for presenting data and visualizing urban transportation systems.  
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Astro, and CSS.  
- **Origin:** Initially developed in the [IHC-UrbanBus repository](https://github.com/martimsantos31/IHC-UrbanBus) and integrated here as the frontend solution.

## Languages and Technologies Used
